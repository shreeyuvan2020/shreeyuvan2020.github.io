# Gaboon Viper

Gaboon vipers are fearsome predators. They produce two tea spoons of venom that deliver a violent, multipoint attack on blood circulation and inject it via two-inch fangs. 

They hide motionless, camouflaged among leaf litter, to ambush their prey - including rodents and even small monkeys and antelopes.
